Monero Rust
===

## What's the purpose of this project?

Rust is an awesome language that support multiple targets and provides a modern environment (compiler, documentation, packet manager, tests, etc) for native applications. Providing a serie of Rust crates that implement various Monero protocols allows the community to build more awesome projects, diversify the Monero ecosystem, and attract more developers.

To enable the power of Monero in modern web environments all crates should compile for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and might propose an interface for JavaScript interaction with `wasm-bindgen`.

**Warning:** All repositories in this project are maintained by community members and not by the Monero Core Team. Make your own researches before using any projects stored in these repositories.

## Why not in the monero ecosystem?

[The Monero Ecosystem](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem) is a great initiative that merit its support, unfortunately GitHub does not allow removing god-access on repositories from organisation founders. So for decentralization and security purposes Monero Rust libraries will not be moved into The Monero Ecosystem at the moment.
