## Hello `monero-rs` :crab:

**Rust** is an awesome language, and we want to bring that into the brilliant world of the [monero-project](https://github.com/monero-project) by providing a serie of Rust crates that implement various parts of the Monero protocol and allow the community to build incredible projects. Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests or specific bugs and errors, also we welcome contributions to our open source projects on Github, just follow the rules of well-being.

### :mag: Have a quick look

If you want to have a quick look here are some libraries available on [crates.io](https://crates.io):

- [`monero`](https://docs.rs/monero), a general purpose library defining types related to Monero.
- [`base58-monero`](https://docs.rs/base58-monero), Monero base58 specific encoding format Rust implementation.
- [`monero-epee-bin-serde`](https://docs.rs/monero-epee-bin-serde), a serde format for the binary encoding defined within the epee helper library of Monero.

### :earth_africa: Part of a bigger ecosystem
